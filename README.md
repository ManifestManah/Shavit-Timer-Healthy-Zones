# Healthy Zones [Shavit Timer]

This plugin may not be important to everybody running a server with a timer, but it is very useful and very liked on our MG Course server. 
When players attempt a run and fail ending up taking damage in the process before using the !r command to go back to the start and reattempt it then the player would have to commit suicide before being able to try running the course again with 100 health. 
This is what the "Healthy Zones" plugin tries to combat. When entering a starting zone the player's health with automatically be set to 100, resulting in less unnecessary inconvenience for the players.
